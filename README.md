# Simple VueJS datepicker

> A Vue.js datepicker configurable with props (options will be added to this README in a close future) so that would be easily reusable with my laravels apps.

## How to use it?

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader). These links are provided by the `vue-cli` package.

## Licence

My datepicker is totally open source. I'm still looking for the most permissive licence (this is an annoying part) because it uses VueJS and some others libraries.
